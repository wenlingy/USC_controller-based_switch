DESCRIPTION OF CODE FILE:

There are 2 different code files in this part

1.mytopo3.py --In this code the following topology was implemented:
	Three linear connected switches plus 2 hosts for switch1, 1 host for switch2 and 1 host for switch3:

   host1 --- switch1 --- switch2 --- switch3 --- host4
                |           |
              host2        host3
	 The hosts had the following IP addresses:
	Host 1 - 10.0.1.2

	Host 2 - 10.0.1.3

	Host 3 - 10.0.2.2

	Host 4 - 10.0.3.2

2.my_router3.py
	In this code we configured the switch in mytopo3.py and we configured 3 static routing tables in order to check the IP address of the hosts. In this case,
		A )when it comes to ARP requests it checks the origination of the packet and whether it comes from subnet 1, subnet 2 or subnet 3.
		If it comes from subnet 1 then it will sent the MAC ID of the switch1; similarly for the packet comes from subnet 2 and subnet3
		B )After ARP it goes to the ICMP request part, it checks whether the destination's IP address is reachable in current routing table.
		If it is not available in the routing table then it says the ICMP destination is unavailable. The same process is repeated for the
		switch 2 and switch3. After this we perform the static routing part where the MAC id of the packet is checked again then sent to
		the corresponding MAC IDs obtained from the routing table.

INSTRUCTIONS ON RUNNING  CODE FILE:

1. This project requires Mininet and VirtualBox softwares in order to function in the correct manner
1. Put my_router3.py in the path /home/mininet/pox/pox/misc
2. Put mytopo3.py in the path /home/mininet

$ sudo mn -c
$ sudo mn --custom mytopo3.py --topo mytopo --mac --switch ovsk --controller remote

3. For the controller part:

Run the controller in /home/mininet/pox

$ ./pox.py log.level --DEBUG misc.my_router3 misc.full_payload

4. To check the packet traffic on any interface

tcpdump -xx -n -i <interface_name>
